#
kubeadm: the command to bootstrap the cluster.
kubelet: the component that runs on all of the machines in your cluster and does things like starting pods and containers.
kubectl: the command line util to talk to your cluster.
#

->  MUST disable swap if the kubelet is not properly configured to use swap.
    For example, sudo swapoff -a will disable swapping temporarily.
    To make this change persistent across reboots, make sure swap is disabled in
    config files like /etc/fstab, systemd.swap, depending how it was configured on your system.


->  To run containers in Pods, Kubernetes uses a container runtime.

By default, Kubernetes uses the Container Runtime Interface (CRI) to interface with your chosen container runtime.
If you don't specify a runtime, kubeadm automatically tries to detect an installed container runtime by scanning through a list of known endpoints.

note :
Docker Engine does not implement the CRI which is a requirement for a container runtime to work with Kubernetes.
For that reason, an additional service cri-dockerd has to be installed
